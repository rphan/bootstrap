# Installation

## Before Installing

___Please backup all of your data___.  You may even want to try it out in a VM before
applying to your personal machine.

This software works great for me, but it comes with no promises.  Use at your own risk!

## Run the installer
_You will be prompted for passwords_

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rphan/homebrew-bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

If you don't have an Apple ID or would simply like to skip installing App Store apps
at this time, set the following variable __before__ installing.

```
export SKIP_MAS=1 ; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rphan/homebrew-bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```
